    "description": "A ripe avocado yields to gentle pressure when held in the palm of the hand and squeezed. The fruit is not sweet, but distinctly and subtly flavored, with smooth texture. The avocado is popular in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content. Generally, avocado is served raw, though some cultivars, including the common 'Hass', can be cooked for a short time without becoming bitter. It is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as guacamole, as well as a spread on corn tortillas or toast, served with spices."

    "description": "The variety is originally from Spain, named after the town of Cari√±ena in the Aragon province. It has been produced in the Languedoc Roussillon region, which used to be part of the Catalunya-Aragon kingdom and became part of France in 1659, since the 12th Century.The area under Carignan production in France has grown significantly over the years, while shrinking in Spain. The variety developed a negative reputation in the 1970s, when French farmers planted thousands of hectares of Carignan because of its high production capacity to cash in on Government aid which was based on production volumes.The result was the production of billions of litres of poor quality Carignan wine. The area under production in France has been greatly reduced since the 1990s, due to government incentives, and there has also been a greater focus on the production of better quality Carignan wines."
